This IDP spanned over two months, but we were able to fully complete the tic tac toe game. To code we used variables, which was super amount for controlling what 'x' and 'o' do. Loops were also a key aspect in coding this game because we had to keep track of the variables and most importantly keep track of its moves. The objects we have in this game are the different spaces where the variables can move/place themselves on. I did not make changes to this code because the game was thoroughly completed.
