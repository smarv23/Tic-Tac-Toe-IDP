This project I really enjoyed and thought we did a very good job and the outcome showed it. Although we had to learn new components of coding like AI. I think the outcome of this project is very strong and think that this has a very cool visual aspect including alot of the code we have learned so far this year. For the six components, we used many variable to control the 'users' or X's and O's. We were able to use arrays to make boards for the game and keep track of moves using objects within our variables. I thought we did a very good job with this code and it didnt need to be revised more.
